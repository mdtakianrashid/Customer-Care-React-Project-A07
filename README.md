# 🧩 Customer Support Zone — React Ticket Management App

Customer Support Zone is a clean, efficient, and fully responsive ticket management application built using **React.js** and **React-Toastify**.  
This project is **My First React Project**.

The application allows users to view customer support tickets, track progress, mark tasks as completed, and maintain real-time status updates with a modern UI inspired by a Figma design.
